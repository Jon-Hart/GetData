Features
========

The features in the summarized dataset come from a 3 axis accelerometer and a 3 axis gyroscope.  The data was originally separated by a low-pass filter into Body and Gravity components using a low frequency Butterworth filter(0.3Hz).

subject: Numerical subject ID
Activity: The actual activity of the subject WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING

The remaining features are the mean value observed for a particular subject and activity.  The features are described using the following.

The first letter is either f or t for frequency domain(FFT transformed) or t for time domain.  
The letters up to the period are particular measurement of the following list.

BodyAcc
GravityAcc
BodyAccJerk
BodyGyro
BodyGyroJerk
BodyAccMag
GravityAccMag
BodyAccJerkMag
BodyGyroMag
BodyGyroJerkMag

After the period is the type of statistical transformation used initially(mean or std for standard deviation).
The second period if present separates the axis direction(X, Y, Z) Where Z is the direction of gravity and X and Y are the horizontal directions.

All measurements have been normalized and bounded to the interval [-1, 1].  Because of the normalization all of the values are unitless.
